# Since the old, free version of maxminds' database has some info that
# the new version has not, it might be a good idea to query it also
# (using geoiplookup). Also, resolving the hostname of a given ip
# would be nice. This script does all this. If you have geoiplookup
# installed, it will query both the "normal" (Country) DB as well as
# the City Edition (if it is located in /usr/share/GeoIP).
# If you have host installed, host <ip> will also be called, which
# should reveal the hostname(s) for the given IP.
