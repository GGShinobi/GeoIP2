#
# geoIP2.py ver 0.0.1
#
# This script can be used to query the maxmind GeoIP2 City database 
# (usually found in '/usr/share/GeoIP/GeoLite2-City.mmdb').
#
# If you don't have the database you can download it from here:
# http://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geoip2/geolite2/
#
# The script requires maxminds' "GeoIP2-python" to be installed on the system.
# You can install it with the following command:
#
#  $ pip install geoip2
#
# When installed correctly, you can open a python console by typing
#
#  $ python
#
# and then check if you can use geoip2 by typing:
#
# >>> import geoip2.database
#
# if this yields an error, geoip2 has not been correctly installed!
# On my system, I also had to make the installed files world-readable in order
# to be able to use them. I did so by changing into the installation directory:
#
#  $ cd /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/
#
# and doing:
#
#  $ sudo find . -type d -exec chmod go+x+r '{}' +
#  $ sudo find . -type f -exec chmod go+r '{}' +
#
# At the moment, the script tries to print the information in only 3 of the
# supported languages, namely in: english (en), german (de) and japanese (ja).
#
# A future release (if it comes) will allow the user to specify the languages
# via command line options. :) And maybe more.
